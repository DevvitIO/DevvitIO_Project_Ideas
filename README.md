### Reddit meets Discord
A chat platform based on reddit and its subreddits. Every subreddit has its own channel, accessible using /r/subreddit like on reddit itself.

Similar to discord, [gitter](https://gitter.im), etc. on the left you find a list of channels (my channels, popular channels, …), in the middle the chat and to the right a list of topics of the subreddit or a userlist (maybe tabs).

What differentiates this chat from the other platforms is its reddit integration. You can reference topics, comments,..., see karma, write PMs, use the same moderation and style settings as the subreddit and more.

### Fact Checker
“Fact Checker” is a platform similar to StackOverflow, where people can provide a statement (video clip, news article, political statement,...) they want to get fact checked. Another user can fact check that statement and is required to provide proper sourcing to validate or discredit the statement. Upvote/Downvotes, credibility of sources and other factors define a score which tells the users if the statement is more likely to be true or false.

The ecosystem around it, is very similar to SO, upvotes/downvotes, users earn reputation (imaginary points), there is a distinction between comments and “answers”, entries are labeled in multiple categories like “subjects”, “source of the statement”, … to enable an easy search.

### HTTP REST API Designer
Design a REST API by setting attributes like *route*, *parameters*, *HTTP method*, *response structure*, *error case*, ... using an interface. Generate a project (for w/e language) based on the defined API. Generate tests that verifier that the API does the defined things. Whenever a user changes the actual implementation of the API, they can run the tests to verify that it still works. It also provided a great documentation for developers or if the API becomes public for external consumers.

There could also be an [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) version of this tool

### Quiz System
Allow "admins" to define questions/answers categorized into subjects/topics. Based on that questions/answers catalogue the app generates a randomized quiz. Users who do this quizzes earn points, which creates a similar progression system as [khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) for example.

### ChessTracker
An app where people can add their chess games (import multiple history formats) to get some statistical data on how they are doing. Let them "replay" their games and let the app suggest "better" moves. Something similar could be implemented for other games as well.

### Netflix for your LAN
Point the app/server to your library of locally stored movies and series and generate a representation in the browser that looks similar to Netflix or any other streaming service. Use public APIs to display additional information for each movie/episode and play them directly in the browser.
