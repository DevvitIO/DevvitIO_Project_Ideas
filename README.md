### Reddit meets Discord
A chat platform based on reddit and its subreddits. Every subreddit has its own channel, accessible using /r/subreddit like on reddit itself.

Similar to discord, [gitter](https://gitter.im), etc. on the left you find a list of channels (my channels, popular channels, …), in the middle the chat and to the right a list of topics of the subreddit or a userlist (maybe tabs).

What differentiates this chat from the other platforms is its reddit integration. You can reference topics, comments,..., see karma, write PMs, use the same moderation and style settings as the subreddit and more.

### Fact Checker
“Fact Checker” is a platform similar to StackOverflow, where people can provide a statement (video clip, news article, political statement,...) they want to get fact checked. Another user can fact check that statement and is required to provide proper sourcing to validate or discredit the statement. Upvote/Downvotes, credibility of sources and other factors define a score which tells the users if the statement is more likely to be true or false.

The ecosystem around it, is very similar to SO, upvotes/downvotes, users earn reputation (imaginary points), there is a distinction between comments and “answers”, entries are labeled in multiple categories like “subjects”, “source of the statement”, … to enable an easy search.

### Competitive Gaming Manager Game
Browser manager game similar to games like [Football Manager 2017](http://www.footballmanager.com/games/football-manager-2017) (Screenshots on the page) for the competitive gaming enivronment (dota, CS, league, w/e)

Since this is a big and complex project this description doesn't include a lot of details, but there already is a collection of ideas.
